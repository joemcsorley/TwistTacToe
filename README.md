# Twist-Tac-Toe

This is a simple game of tic-tac-toe, but with a little twist.  Here's what you need to know:
1. Player X plays,
2. Player O plays,
3. All the pieces on the board rotate to new positions based on the numeric map (1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, ...9 goes to 1).
4. In order to win, the pieces must rotate into a winning position.
